# Welcome!
Welcome to our reposity. You can find our source code within the TeamCode/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode folder. 
The rest of the code is provided by FIRST, and is open source. 

Our Autonomous files are all based on the Robot object. 

You can find all of our current code in the "Current" folder. 

The reference folder contains sensor testing programs, and old architechtures we tested.
We are still working on getting the  options menu to work properly, but you can find the code for that in the "options" folder.

If you have any questions, please come talk to us in our pit!
